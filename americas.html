            <p><strong>Location: </strong>University of Alaska in Fairbanks (UAF), USA</p>
            <p> <strong> Program Description: </strong> Live,  study, and learn in Fairbanks, Alaska!

                This course at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks (UAF) aims to provide students with the tools to understand their own relationship with apology, forgiveness, and reconciliation through the lens of Alaska Natives. To achieve this, students will learn about the struggles of Alaska Natives seeking recognition for their suffering and working to forgive and reconcile with Alaska’s state government, the U.S. federal government, and business communities who have impacted their livelihood, education, access to natural resources, and culture.

                The first week, led by Shai Tamari from UNC-Chapel Hill, will focus on our own relationships with apology and forgiveness and the internal conflicts we struggle with: How and why do we react to conflict? How has our past impacted the way we respond to conflicts today? And what actions must we take to improve our relationships with others? This will be done through learning and practicing High-Quality Listening, which will then be used by students to engage with speakers in weeks 2 & 3.

                The second and third week will be dedicated to understanding the history, politics, cultures, and education system of Alaska Natives’ communities. These sessions will be led by Dr. Michael Koskey from UAF, and will include guest-speakers and meetings with tribal leaders, policy-makers, NGOs, and activists.

                The lectures, meetings, and excursions in weeks 2 and 3 will be tied back to apology, forgiveness, and reconciliation through group discussions led by Shai Tamari each day, allowing students to better understand the challenges and successes faced by Alaska Natives as they attempt to live side-by-side with non-Native people.

                Classes take place in the morning, with excursions held each afternoon, allowing students to discover Fairbanks and its surroundings, and to see and experience first-hand what they have been studying in class.
