                <p> <strong>Program Description: </strong>In 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was established with three aims: to become an internationally recognized institution; to foster an understanding of the Jewish state; and to be the finest university of Israel. Almost seventy-five years later, each of these ambitions has been realized by the University in the capital of Israel.

                    Approximately 3,000 of the 18,000 students at this non-denominational university are international students. The Rothberg School for Overseas Students, established in 1971, recognizes and facilitates the curricula of international students at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
