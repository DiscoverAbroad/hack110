            <p> <strong>Program Description: </strong> Established in 1973, Murdoch is committed to excellence in research and teaching. It has an extensive range of international contacts, resulting in a cosmopolitan campus with over 3,000 international students in a student body of 25,000. The campus itself makes Murdoch an excellent place to study as well: the university is set in natural bushland and is landscaped with native Australian flora.

                The academic year at Murdoch is divided into two semesters: the first semester runs from February to June, and the second semester runs from July to November. Students should keep in mind that the Australian summer is from December to February and the winter is from June to August. Year-long students may attend either the US academic calendar (July-June, with a long break between terms) or the Australian calendar year (February-December).
